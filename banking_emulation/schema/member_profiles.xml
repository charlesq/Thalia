    <!-- member status may be "pre-approved","active" "locked"
         "pre-approved" indicates that the customer submitted a application 
         to open accounts and bank approval is pending and  no transactions/
         acctivities are allowed in any associated accounts.

         once approved, status is changed to "active", and the new customer
         becomees a regular member and may use the services.  
        
         For any reason such as "compromised account seurity", the status
         will change to "locked".
  
         Only after the issues have been resolved, the "active" status 
         will resume.
         
         Note: for simplification purpose: age info is not recored.
